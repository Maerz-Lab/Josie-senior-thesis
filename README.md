"The objective of this research is to use a long-term data set among wetlands undergoing restoration and reference, unrestored wetlands to determine what terrestrial and aquatic factors including wetland restoration actions are predictive of A. tigrinum occupancy at ARWMA." 
 
"I hypothesize that Tiger salamanders are more likely to breed at wetlands with open canopies and dense emergent vegetation and surrounded by uplands of low canopy cover. I hypothesize that Tiger salamander occupancy will also be positively associated with the filling of historic ditches, removal of tree canopy, and the reintroduction of fire to wetlands since 2019. I also hypothesize that wetlands with greater proximity to a larger number of other wetlands will have higher Tiger salamander occupancy and reduced breeding extinction."
